    "### 🧠 What is an LLM?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is a type of AI model designed to understand and generate human-like text based on patterns learned from massive amounts of training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Description |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Size & Scale** | Trained on billions of tokens from books, articles, websites, videos |\n",
    "| **Pretraining** | Learns statistical relationships between words and sentences |\n",
    "| **Fine-tuning** | Specialized for specific tasks like classification, translation, etc. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Scale Comparison of Popular LLMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Parameters | Training Tokens |\n",
    "|-------|------------|----------------|\n",
    "| GPT-3 (Davinci) | 175 billion | 499 billion |\n",
    "| Llama 3.1 | 8B - 405B | 15 trillion |\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🔤 Understanding Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs don't process text character by character. Instead, they use **tokens** - chunks of text that are processed as single units.\n",

      "The sky looks blue because the Earth's atmosphere scatters short wavelength light (blue light) more than it does long wavelength light (red light), causing blue light to be reflected back to our eyes while red light passes through and appears as less visible. This phenomenon is known as scattering, and it's due to the presence of tiny particles in the atmosphere, such as dust, water vapor, and air molecules. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with these particles and scatters in all directions, causing the blue light to be more dispersed than other colors, resulting in the appearance of a blue sky. This is what creates the blue color we see when we look up at the sky. The amount of scattering depends on the angle of the sun and the amount of particles in the air, which can vary throughout the day and in different weather conditions, creating different shades of blue or even orange or pink skies during sunrise and sunset. However, during pollution or smoggy conditions, the atmosphere can appear hazy or gray due to high levels of particulate matter, resulting in a less blue sky. This effect is called the Rayleigh scattering. This is why the sun appears red\n"

      "Photosynthesis is a biological process that occurs in green plants, algae, and some bacteria, through which they convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose and oxygen. During photosynthesis, chlorophyll in plant cells captures light energy and converts carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose in the presence of water and chlorophyll. This process is essential for the growth and survival of most living organisms, as it provides energy for plants to sustain life and releases oxygen into the atmosphere, which is essential for all living beings to breathe. This process takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells and is essential for the ecosystem as it produces food for herbivores and other organisms, and serves as the base of the food chain. It is a vital process for the maintenance of the earth's atmosphere, as it contributes to the oxygen-nitrogen cycle and helps to maintain the balance of carbon dioxide levels.\n",

      "This code snippet is defining a function called `fibonacci` that takes an argument `n`. This function uses recursive calls to calculate the nth number of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical sequence where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. For example, the first two numbers are 0 and 1. The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it returns `n` since the base case is when the number is 0 or 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the function calls itself recursively to get the (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers and adds them together to get the `n`th number. So, for instance, if we call `fibonacci(5)`, it will call itself recursively for `n-1` (which is `4`) and get the 4th and 3rd numbers, add them up, and return the 5th number. This continues until we reach the base case (0 or 1) and return the final answer. This function will keep calling itself to calculate all the numbers\n"
