    "- **Nodes** represent computational steps (e.g., calling an LLM or using a tool)\n",
    "- **Edges** define how the workflow proceeds based on output or state\n",

      "Now, here's how to prepare your Pasta Carbonara:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cook pasta**: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente.\n",
      "2. **Fry pancetta**: In a large skillet, cook the pancetta over medium heat until crispy. Remove from heat and set aside.\n",
      "3. **Mix egg yolks with cheese**: In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and Pecorino cheese until smooth.\n",
      "4. **Combine hot pasta with pancetta**: Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta and toss to combine.\n",
      "5. **Quickly mix in egg mixture**: Pour the egg yolk mixture over the pasta and pancetta, and quickly stir to combine. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs slightly, creating a creamy sauce.\n",
      "6. **Season with pepper**: Add black pepper to taste, and serve immediately.\n",

    "## 📝 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we learned how to build **AI Agents** using **LangGraph** with local LLMs (Ollama):\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LangGraph** structures agent logic as a **directed graph**:\n",
    "   - Nodes = computational steps (LLM calls, tool use)\n",
    "   - Edges = workflow transitions based on state/output\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ReAct Pattern** enables step-by-step reasoning:\n",
    "   - Thought → Action → Observation → Repeat until solved\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tools** extend agent capabilities:\n",
    "   - Built-in: DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia (free, no API keys!)\n",
    "   - Custom: Use `@tool` decorator on Python functions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memory** enables conversational context:\n",
    "   - `State` class maintains message history\n",
    "   - `add_messages` handles merging and appending\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "| Practice | Why It Matters |\n",
    "|----------|----------------|\n",
    "| Write clear tool descriptions | Agents use descriptions to decide which tool to use |\n",
    "| Use type hints | Helps agents understand input/output formats |\n",
    "| Include docstrings | Provides context for tool selection |\n",
    "| Maintain state properly | Enables context-aware conversations |\n",
    "| Use local LLMs (Ollama) | Privacy, cost savings, no rate limits |\n",

    "- Explore **LangGraph Studio** for visualizing and debugging agents\n",
    "- Build **multi-agent systems** where agents collaborate\n",
    "- Add **persistent storage** for long-term memory across sessions\n",
    "- Create agents that can **write and execute code**\n",
    "- Integrate with **databases** and **external APIs**"
