      "Q: What is a decorator in Python and when would I use one?\n",
      "\n",
      "A: A decorator in Python is a design pattern that allows you to modify the behavior of a function or class without permanently modifying it, by abstracting away common functionality from similar functions/classes. Decorators are syntactic sugar that makes code more readable and reusable. They can be used for various purposes such as logging, caching, authorization checks, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a simple example of how to use a decorator:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def my_decorator(func):\n",
      "    def wrapper():\n",
      "        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n",
      "        func()\n",
      "        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n",
      "    return wrapper\n",
      "\n",
      "@my_decorator\n",
      "def say_hello():\n",
      "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, `say_hello` is a decorated function. When you call `say_hello()`, it will first print \"Something is happening before the function is called.\", then execute the original function (which prints \"Hello!\"), and finally print \"Something is happening after the function is called.\". \n",
      "\n",
      "The decorator pattern separates cross-cutting concerns from the main functionality of a function or class, making it easier to manage and maintain code. It's useful when you want to add additional behavior around the execution of a function without permanently modifying it.\n"

    "1. **GPT4All** enables running LLMs locally without cloud dependencies\n",
    "2. **GGUF format** provides efficient model storage with quantization\n",
    "3. **Chat sessions** vs **direct generation** serve different purposes\n",
    "4. **Generation parameters** (temperature, top_k, top_p) control output\n",
    "5. **Streaming** enables real-time response display\n",
    "6. **Embeddings** power semantic search and RAG applications\n",
