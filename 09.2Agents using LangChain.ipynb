    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on building **AI Agents** using LangChain!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are AI Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **AI Agent** is an autonomous system powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) that can:\n",
    "- **Reason** about a given task or query\n",
    "- **Plan** a sequence of actions to accomplish the goal\n",
    "- **Use tools** to interact with external systems (search, APIs, databases)\n",
    "- **Iterate** based on observations until the task is complete\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LangChain?\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is a powerful framework for building LLM-powered applications. It provides:\n",
    "- **Modular architecture** - compose prompts, memory, tools, and chains\n",
    "- **Tool integration** - easily connect to external APIs and services\n",
    "- **Agent frameworks** - built-in support for ReAct, function calling, and more\n",
    "- **Rich ecosystem** - extensive community tools and integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Cover\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting up Ollama** - Connect to locally running LLM\n",
    "2. **Built-in Tools** - Use DuckDuckGo search and Wikipedia\n",
    "3. **Creating Agents** - Build ReAct agents that reason and act\n",
    "4. **Custom Tools** - Create your own tools with the `@tool` decorator\n",
    "5. **Multi-Tool Agent** - Combine multiple tools for complex tasks"

      "The field of quantum computing has seen significant advancements in recent years, with several breakthroughs and innovations that have expanded its potential applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the latest developments in quantum computing is the integration of quantum computers into drug discovery and clinical trials. Quantum computers can process vast amounts of data exponentially faster than classical computers, making them ideal for simulating complex molecular interactions and predicting the efficacy of new drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to drug discovery, quantum computing also has the potential to revolutionize fields such as finance, logistics, and cybersecurity. By leveraging the power of qubits, quantum computers can solve complex problems that are currently unsolvable with traditional computers.\n",
      "\n",
      "While quantum computing won't replace traditional development methods overnight, it's essential for developers who want to stay ahead in this emerging field. Learning about quantum computing requires a willingness to explore new ways of thinking, but it can provide a significant head start in the next computing revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "IBM Quantum is a full-stack quantum computing provider that offers access to the world's largest fleet of 100+ qubit quantum computers and performant Qiskit software tools. Trusted by 300+ clients and partners, IBM Quantum is a leading player in the global cloud-based quantum computing market.\n",
      "\n",

    "## 📝 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we learned how to build AI Agents using LangChain with local LLMs (Ollama):\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agents** are autonomous systems that can reason, plan, and use tools\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tools** are the interfaces through which agents interact with external systems\n",
    "   - Built-in tools: DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, etc.\n",
    "   - Custom tools: Use `@tool` decorator on Python functions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ReAct Framework** enables step-by-step reasoning:\n",
    "   - Thought → Action → Observation → Repeat until solved\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Modern LangChain API**:\n",
    "   - `create_react_agent()` - Creates the agent logic\n",
    "   - `AgentExecutor` - Runs the agent and handles tool execution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "| Practice | Why It Matters |\n",
    "|----------|----------------|\n",
    "| Write clear tool descriptions | Agents use descriptions to decide which tool to use |\n",
    "| Use type hints | Helps agents understand input/output formats |\n",
    "| Set `max_iterations` | Prevents infinite loops |\n",
    "| Enable `verbose=True` | Debug and understand agent reasoning |\n",
    "| Handle parsing errors | Makes agents more robust |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore **LangGraph** for more complex agent workflows\n",
    "- Add **memory** to your agents for conversation context\n",
    "- Build agents that can **write and execute code**\n",
    "- Create **multi-agent systems** where agents collaborate"
